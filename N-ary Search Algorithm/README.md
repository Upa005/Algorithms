This paper presents the performance analysis of n-ary search
algorithm with different value of n (partitions) which is based
on divide and conquer strategy.
APPROACH
In n-ary search algorithm, array is partitioned into n equal
parts recursively until the required key is obtained. For the
analysis, array of a certain size is taken and it is filled with
random integer values generated by random function. All the
array elements are then sorted. The array is then divided into
n number of partitions where n begins from two and increases
consecutively till it reaches the size of the array. N-ary search
algorithm is used and the average time taken to search a
random element in the array is calculated.
EXPERIMENT
An array of size 100 is taken and is filled with 100 random
values. The array is then sorted using bubble sort algorithm.
A key is generated randomly from the array elements and
it is then searched by n-ary search algorithm with different
portioning values. The number of partitions begins from 2 and
it keeps on increasing till it reaches the size of array that is
100. For every partitioning value, n, the array elements and
the key are generated 5,00,000 times and searching operation
is performed on it. The average time for searching in each
partition is calculated. The result (number of partitions and
the average time taken for searching) is stored in a text file
and a graph is plotted from the result. The platform used for
compilation and execution is Ubuntu 15.10 and the graph is
plotted using octave-3.6.4
I. RESULT
Table 1 and figure 1 depicts the results of n-ary search. Table
1 shows the partitioning number (n) and the corresponding
time taken (average) in seconds for searching the key. The
result is depicted graphically in figure 1.
DISCUSSION
In n-ary search, initially time taken to search the key
decreases with increase in the number of partitions. But after
certain partitioning value, the time taken to search increases
with increase in the number of partitions. As the result is
performed on random values, there may be difference in
the number of worst cases, average cases and best cases

with different partitioning value. In this experiment, initially
the time taken decreases with the increase in number of
partitions.At n=4, time taken to search a key is almost similar
to that for n=2 because the number of worst cases dominates
the number of average cases. At n=10, the performance of nary
search algorithm is maximum as the average time taken to
search is 0.056426s, which is the global minima in the graph
1. But after this, the performance decreases with the increase
in number of partitions, although there are some local minima
and maxima in certain points in the graph.
CONCLUSION
The performance of n-ary search initially increases with
increase in number of partitions. After a certain partitioning
value, n, the performance decreases and the time to search
increases. Hence, for most efficient search, use the partitioning
value which yields the maximum performance.
