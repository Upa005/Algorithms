This repo contains codes in C++ for certain algorithms and their analysis

* [Linear Search Algorithm](https://github.com/Upa005/Algorithms/tree/master/Linear%20Search%20Algorithm)
1. Description - Linear search is a method for finding a key value within a list or array. It sequentially checks each element of the    list for the key value until a match is found or until all the elements have been searched.
2. [Linear Search C++ Program](https://github.com/Upa005/Algorithms/blob/master/Linear%20Search%20Algorithm/linear_search.cpp)
3.  [Analysis](https://github.com/Upa005/Algorithms/blob/master/Linear%20Search%20Algorithm/Output/Graph.docx)

* [N-ary Search Algorithm](https://github.com/Upa005/Algorithms/blob/master/N-ary%20Search%20Algorithm)
1. Description - In n-ary search algorithm, array is partitioned into n equal parts recursively until the required key is obtained. For the analysis, array of a certain size is taken and it is filled with random integer values generated by random function. All the array elements are then sorted. The array is then divided into n number of partitions where n begins from two and increases consecutively till it reaches the size of the array. N-ary search algorithm is used and the average time taken to search a random element in the array is calculated.

* [Finding maximum, minimum element (array)](https://github.com/Upa005/Algorithms/blob/master/Max-MIn%20Search)
1. Description - This analysis presents comparative study of divide and
      conquers algorithm and brute force search algorithm to find maximum element and minimum element in an array. It is
      observed that the time required to execute and run divide and
      conquer algorithm is more than the time required to execute
      and run brute-force search algorithm. This result is contrary
      to the believe that divide and conquer algorithm always give
     the best result than that of brute force algorithm
2. [Max_Min C++ Program](https://github.com/Upa005/Algorithms/blob/master/Max-MIn%20Search/max_min.cpp)
3. [Analysis](https://github.com/Upa005/Algorithms/blob/master/Max-MIn%20Search/readme.pdf)

* [Quick Sort](https://github.com/Upa005/Algorithms/tree/master/Quick_Sort)
1. Description - This analysis presents comparative study of deterministic quick sort and randomized quick sort. It is observed that the time required to execute and run deterministic quick sort is more than the time required to execute and run randomized quick sort for both sorted and unsorted array elements. 
2. [Quick Sort C++ Program](https://github.com/Upa005/Algorithms/blob/master/Quick_Sort/sqsort01.cpp)

* [Prims-Kruskal Algorithm](https://github.com/Upa005/Algorithms/tree/master/Prims-Kruskal)
1. Description -To draw a minimum spanning tree using Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithm and represent it
graphically by drawing nodes and edges.
2. [Kruskal C++ Program](https://github.com/Upa005/Algorithms/blob/master/Prims-Kruskal/Kruskal/EDGE2.CPP)
3. [Prims C++ Program](https://github.com/Upa005/Algorithms/blob/master/Prims-Kruskal/Prims/EDGES.CPP)
4. [Analysis](https://github.com/Upa005/Algorithms/blob/master/Prims-Kruskal/mst03.pdf)
        
* [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://github.com/Upa005/Algorithms/tree/master/Dijkistra)
1. Description -  The single source shortest path problem is to compute the shortest paths from a source vertex to a destination vertex in a directed weighted connected graph.
2. [C++ Program](https://github.com/Upa005/Algorithms/blob/master/Dijkistra/GDIJI.CPP)
3. [Analysis](https://github.com/Upa005/Algorithms/blob/master/Dijkistra/diji.pdf)

* [All Pair Shortest Path algorithm](https://github.com/Upa005/Algorithms/tree/master/All_Pair_Shortest)
1. Description -  The all pairs shortest path problem is to compute the shortest paths of vertices of a directed weighted connected graph.
2. [C++ Program](https://github.com/Upa005/Algorithms/tree/master/All_Pair_Shortest/MY_APS01.CPP)
3. [Analysis](https://github.com/Upa005/Algorithms/tree/master/All_Pair_Shortest/aps.pdf)

* [N-Queen](https://github.com/Upa005/Algorithms/tree/master/N-Queen)
1. Description - The N–Queen is the problem of placing N chess queens on an n×n chessboard so that no two queens attack each other. A queen can attack other queen if they share the same row, column, or diagonal. Chess composer Max Bezzel published the eight queens puzzle in 1848. Franz Nauck published the first solutions in 1850.

* [Line Drawing Algorithm](https://github.com/Upa005/Algorithms/tree/master/Line_Drawing_Algo)
1. Description - A line drawing algorithm is a graphical algorithm used for drawing a line segment on adiscrete graphical media.        Algorithm used for drawing lines are simple DDA, symmetric DDA, Breshenam line drawing algorithm and mid point line drawing algorithm.
